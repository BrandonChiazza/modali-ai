                <p>
                    Brandon Chiazza is a data analytics and visualization instructor and the Chief Technology Officer
                    in the New York City Mayor’s Office of Contract Services. He leads a team of 50 independent consultants
                    and directs employees in three units: Enterprise Data Services, Project Management Office, and Design
                    and Quality Assurance, in the technology strategy division.

                    As part of his job, he oversaw the technical implementation of several significant projects, including
                    PASSPort Release 1, the replacement for VENDEX, the city’s vendor portal for vetting and preparing to
                    do business with the city; PASSPort Release 2, the replacement of the city's purchasing system and
                    the centralized creation of a citywide invoicing system; and Release 3, the city’s sourcing-to-contract
                    system. The $50 million PASSPort project, an end-to-end cloud-based procurement solution for the City
                    of New York, supports approximately 50,000 transactions and $21 billion in spending annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, he oversaw the development of an Enterprise Data Warehouse & Business Intelligence
                    system, a project that consolidated citywide procurement and contracting legacy systems into a
                    centralized warehouse while leveraging a cloud-based infrastructure.
